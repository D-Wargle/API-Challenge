## Description 

The Weather Dashboard is a full-stack application that allows users to view the current weather and a 5-day forecast for any city. By utilizing the OpenWeather 5-day weather forecast API, the application fetches and displays up-to-date weather data. Users can search for cities, and their searches are saved to a search history, which allows for quick access to previous searches. Users can also delete cities from their search history, giving them control over their saved data. This weather app provides an intuitive and interactive way to stay informed about the weather.
